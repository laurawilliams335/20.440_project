Overview

This repository contains the data and code needed to produce Figures 4 and 5 from the first draft of our report. The matrix.mtx.gz, features.tsv.gz, and barcodes.tsv.gz were 
downloaded from GEO Accession GSE289268, which contains the single cell sequencing data from Rodrigues et al. (Cell, 2025). Using this datset, we ran principal component analysis 
on the single cell sequencing data and clustered the cells to generate a UMAP plot. We then identified genes upregulated in each of the clusters and, focusing on cluster 6 (Roryt+ APCs), and ran gene ontology enrichment analysis to produce a dot plot of upregulated pathways in this cluster. 

Data

Mesenteric lymph nodes were harvested from 15-day-old RorcE+7kbWT/WT mice and sorted for CD45+CD3−B220−CD11c+MHC-II+ DCs and CD45+CD3−B220−CD11c−CCR6+ ILC3s. Samples were pooled and sequenced using a 10x Genomics Chromium Single Cell Controller.

Organization

The code needed to produce figures 4 and 5 from our report is contained in the folder 'code' in the file Figure4-5.R, and all the data needed is in matrix.mtx.gz, barcodes.tsv.gz, and features.tsv.gz in the folder 'data'. 

Running the code

Download R and Rstudio to run the code. All of the necessary packages will be installed and the figures will be generated by running the entire Figure4-5.R script.
